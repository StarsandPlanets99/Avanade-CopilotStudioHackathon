# AI Training Enrollment Agent Lab Overview

This lab guides you through building a **Copilot Studio agent** to help employees explore and request training. You will enhance the agent with **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** for policy answers, **Adaptive Card inputs**, **prompt flows** for cost calculation, and an optional **Agent flow**.

The lab focuses on low-code tools and no-code orchestration using Copilot Studio’s built-in GPT capabilities.

## What You’ll Build

1. A Copilot Studio agent enhanced with:
   - A **knowledge source** (e.g. Word doc) that enables **generative Q&A** about training policies
   - **AI-generated responses** via GPT-4o orchestration

2. A **guided topic** that:
   - Uses an **Adaptive Card** to collect the user's course selection
   - Sends the selected input to a prompt

3. A **prompt flow** that:
   - Maps course selections to pricing tiers
   - Applies rules (e.g. discounts)
   - Returns a costed message with no code required

4. An **optional Agent flow** that:
   - Sends a course approval request to a hardcoded manager
   - Returns the decision to the agent

5. A polished conversational experience with a friendly, helpful agent.

## Key Capabilities You’ll Learn

| Feature / Pattern                      | What You'll Learn & Do                                                      |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Knowledge Q&A (RAG)**               | Upload a Word doc and enable generative answers for training policy queries |
| **System Variables**                  | Auto-capture the user’s email with `User.Email`                             |
| **Topics with Adaptive Cards**        | Collect structured input using choice sets inside a conversation            |
| **Prompt Engineering**                | Use prompt flows to dynamically calculate course cost                       |
| **Variable Management**               | Store and use topic-level and prompt-level variables                        |
| **Agent Flows (optional)**         | Trigger an approval flow and handle responses in the agent                  |
| **GPT-4o Orchestration**              | Let the agent guide conversations using natural language understanding      |
| **End-to-end testing**                | Preview and test the agent in Copilot Studio’s built-in chat simulator      |

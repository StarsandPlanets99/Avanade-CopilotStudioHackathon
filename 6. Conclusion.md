## What's Next? Extend This Lab with Your Own Ideas

Now that you've built an AI-powered training enrollment agent using Copilot Studio, why stop here? The skills you've learned‚Äîlike using knowledge sources, adaptive cards, prompt flows, and approval automation‚Äîcan be applied to many other workplace scenarios.

Below are just a few ideas to inspire you. Why not come up with your own hackathon idea?  
Better yet, ask M365 Copilot to help brainstorm it with you!  
You're now equipped with everything you need to start solving real-world problems with AI‚Äîone conversation at a time.


Below are realistic and valuable use cases that follow the same technology patterns as your AI Training Enrollment Agent lab ‚Äî meaning they combine:

- RAG / Knowledge Q&A (retrieval-augmented generation)
- Copilot Studio topics with GPT-4o orchestration
- Adaptive Cards for structured input
- Prompt flows for logic/calculation
- (Optional) Power Automate flows for human-in-the-loop approvals or external action

- Use prompt flow to personalize answers or flag policy violations  
- Optional: Power Automate flow to send unanswered questions to HR  

üõ†Ô∏è **Patterns Used:**  
Knowledge (RAG), prompt-based generation, conditional logic, fallback escalation.

üßæ **3. Expense Eligibility Checker**  
**Scenario:** Employees want to check if an expense is allowed and reimbursable.

- Upload company travel/expense policy as knowledge source  
- Adaptive Card to enter expense type and amount  
- Prompt returns allowed/not allowed message based on inputs  
- Power Automate flow (optional) for compliance team review

- Prompt evaluates impact based on goal alignment (using markdown or rubric)  
- Knowledge base contains corporate sustainability goals  
- Optional approval flow to funding committee  

üõ†Ô∏è **Patterns Used:**  
Prompt grading, knowledge context, approval loop.

üìö **5. Course Recommendation Assistant**  
**Scenario:** An agent suggests learning paths based on job role or skills gap.

- User inputs job title or skills via Adaptive Card  
- Prompt flow maps input to learning track  
- Optionally include certification exam cost, duration, etc.  
- Pulls course info from uploaded course catalog (Word or Excel)  

üõ†Ô∏è **Patterns Used:**  
Structured input ‚Üí dynamic output, prompt recommendation engine, document RAG.

---

üí¨ **6. IT Troubleshooting Guide**  
**Scenario:** Employees describe a tech problem and the agent guides troubleshooting.

- GPT-driven orchestration guides user through steps  
- Prompt selects right path based on device type and issue  
- Adaptive Cards used for yes/no or multi-step decision trees  
- Knowledge base includes helpdesk SOPs  

üõ†Ô∏è **Patterns Used:**  
GPT-4o conversational branching, prompt decision flow, document-driven answers.
